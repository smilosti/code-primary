Organizing your `/code/` directory to include both your actual code and Markdown documentation while following a mono-repo structure can help maintain clarity and efficiency. Here's a recommended structure that separates code from documentation but keeps everything within the same repository for ease of management:

### Recommended `/code/` Directory Structure

```
/code/
├── README.md                # General overview of the repository
├── LICENSE                  # License for the repository
├── .gitignore               # Git ignore file
├── .github/                 # GitHub-specific files (actions, issue templates, etc.)
│   └── workflows/
│       └── ci.yml
├── docs/                    # Documentation folder for all Markdown files
│   ├── notes/
│   │   └── compliance-notes.md
│   └── projects/
│       └── compliance-ontology/
│           └── project-plan.md
├── scripts/                 # Common scripts for development, build, and deployment
│   ├── build.sh
│   ├── deploy.sh
│   └── test.sh
├── configs/                 # Common configuration files
│   ├── eslint.json

    ├── e2e/
    │   ├── test-case-1.spec.js
    │   └── test-case-2.spec.js
    └── utils/
        ├── mock-data.js
        └── test-helpers.js
```

### Explanation

1. **Root Directory**:
   - **README.md**: An overview of the entire repository.
   - **LICENSE**: License information.
   - **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to ignore in Git.
   - **.github/**: GitHub-specific configurations, such as CI workflows.

2. **docs/**:
   - **notes/**: Markdown files for notes.
   - **projects/**: Project-specific documentation.

3. **scripts/**:
   - Contains common scripts for building, deploying, and testing.

4. **configs/**:
   - Centralized configuration files for tools like ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript.

5. **shared-libs/**:
   - Libraries that are shared across multiple projects, with their own source code and package files.

6. **services/**:
   - Backend services or microservices, each with its own source code, configurations, and Dockerfile.

7. **apps/**:
   - Frontend applications or client-side projects, each with its own source code and public assets.

8. **tests/**:
   - End-to-end tests and shared test utilities.

### Benefits

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Keeps documentation organized separately from the code, but within the same repository for easy access.
2. **Scalability**: This structure scales well as your projects grow, allowing for the addition of more services, apps, or shared libraries.
3. **Maintainability**: Clear organization makes it easier to maintain and navigate the repository.
4. **Consistency**: Using a consistent structure helps team members understand where to find and place new files.

### Using VS Code with This Structure

1. **Open the Repository**:
   - Open VS Code and navigate to your `/code/` directory.
   - Use `File -> Open Folder...` and select `/code/`.

2. **Manage Documentation**:
   - Navigate to the `docs/` folder to create and edit Markdown files.
   - Use Markdown extensions in VS Code for enhanced editing and previewing.

3. **Manage Code**:
   - Navigate to `apps/`, `services/`, or `shared-libs/` to work on different parts of your projects.
   - Use VS Code’s built-in Git integration to manage version control.

4. **Run Scripts and Tests**:
   - Use the integrated terminal in VS Code to run scripts from the `scripts/` directory.
   - Execute tests from the `tests/` directory.

By following this structure, you can efficiently manage both your code and documentation, keeping everything well-organized and easy to work with.

### It is generally a good idea to initialize Git for your `/code/` directory structure right away. Here are a few reasons why initializing Git early is beneficial:

### Benefits of Initializing Git Early

1. **Version Control from the Start**: You can track all changes from the beginning, which helps in maintaining a clean history of your project development.
2. **Safety and Backup**: Committing your changes frequently ensures that you have a backup of your work. If something goes wrong, you can always revert to a previous state.
3. **Collaboration**: If you plan to collaborate with others, having Git set up from the start allows others to clone the repository and contribute easily.
4. **Continuous Integration**: If you plan to set up CI/CD pipelines, having Git initialized is a prerequisite for integrating with tools like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.
5. **Project Management**: Git allows you to use branches for features, bug fixes, and experiments, which helps in managing your project more efficiently.

### How to Initialize Git

1. **Navigate to the `/code/` Directory**:
    ```bash
    cd ~/code
    ```

2. **Initialize the Git Repository**:
    ```bash
    git init
    ```

3. **Add All Files to the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

4. **Commit the Initial Structure**:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Initial commit: set up directory structure"
    ```

5. **Set Up a Remote Repository**:
    - Create a new repository on GitHub, GitLab, or another Git hosting service.
    - Add the remote repository:
        ```bash
        git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
        ```
    - Push your changes to the remote repository:
        ```bash
        git push -u origin main
        ```

### Example Commands

Here's a condensed version of the commands you will run:

```bash
cd ~/code
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: set up directory structure"
git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
git push -u origin main
```

### Conclusion

Initializing Git for your `/code/` directory structure now is a proactive step that will benefit you in managing your project effectively from the beginning. It enables version control, facilitates collaboration, and sets the stage for integrating other development tools and practices.

### Here's how you can create a new PAT and use it to push your changes:

### Step-by-Step Guide to Create a New PAT

1. **Log In to GitHub**:
    - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and log in to your account.

2. **Navigate to Settings**:
    - Click on your profile picture in the upper-right corner, then select `Settings`.

3. **Go to Developer Settings**:
    - Scroll down in the left sidebar and click on `Developer settings`.

4. **Personal Access Tokens**:
    - Click on `Personal access tokens`, then `Tokens (classic)`.

5. **Generate New Token**:
    - Click the `Generate new token` button.
    - Give your token a descriptive name (e.g., `Mono-Repo Setup`).
    - Select the scopes (permissions) you need. At a minimum, select `repo` for full control of private repositories.
    - Click the `Generate token` button at the bottom.

6. **Copy the Token**:
    - Copy the newly generated token. You won’t be able to see it again, so make sure to copy it now and store it securely.

### Using the PAT with Git

1. **Remove Existing Remote (if not done yet)**:
    ```bash
    cd ~/code
    git remote remove origin
    ```

2. **Add the Correct Remote Origin**:
    Add the remote origin with your repository URL:
    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/smilosti/your-repo-name.git
    ```

3. **Push Your Changes Using PAT**:
    When you push your changes, Git will prompt you for a username and password. Use your GitHub username as the username and the PAT as the password.

    ```bash
    git push -u origin main
    ```

### Complete Command Sequence

Here’s the full sequence of commands:

```bash
cd ~/code
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/smilosti/your-repo-name.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

When prompted for a username and password during `git push`, use your GitHub username and the newly created PAT.

### Using Git Credential Manager (Optional)

If you want to avoid entering your PAT every time, you can use Git Credential Manager to store your credentials securely.

1. **Install Git Credential Manager**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install git-credential-manager-core
    ```

2. **Configure Git to Use the Credential Manager**:
    ```bash
    git config --global credential.helper manager-core
    ```

When you push your changes, you’ll be prompted to enter your PAT once, and it will be stored securely for future use.

### Conclusion

Generating a new PAT and using it with Git is straightforward. Follow the steps above to create your token and use it to push your changes.
